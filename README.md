# GroVID19
This tool was created in the framework of the CodeVsCovid19 Hackathon.
We tackeld the issue of panic buying during the Covid19 pandemic in early 2020. As people started stocking toilet paper and other basic goods an even distribution of shoppers to grocery stores can help to alleviate temporary shortages. We used the Google Maps Places API (https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro?hl=de) together with the on top built Populartimes library (https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes) to use the first's popular times feature. 

By asking the user to type in an address, a type of store and a search radius we are able to give an advice to visit the currently least crowded store.

## How to get started
+ Get a Google Maps API key https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key
+ replace the dummy API key with your own key
+ Install Populartimes from github using `pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/m-wrzr/populartimes`
